# #59. Constrained MST
A Tabu Search application to the children-constrained constrained MST problem

This project was made as a part of the Operational Reaserch exam from my master's degree program at the University of Ferrara.

### Description
Given an undirected, non-complete graph, and given a node r, find the root r spanning tree that minimizes the number of children of each node -1.  
In other words, given a spanning tree, oriented from the root, each nonleaf node i has ki â‰¥ 1 children. We want to minimize the sum over all i nonleaf nodes by ki-1.
